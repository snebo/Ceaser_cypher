# Ceaser_cypher
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## Task
Build a ceaser cypher that takes a string and returns the encrypted message. (Bonus: it should be able to decrypt messages too)

| decrypt      | returns the decrypted message. It can be passed a second argument to change the decryption key ie; #decrypt("Hello") #=> "khoor"  #decrypt(Hello,2) #=> "Jgnnq" |
| encrypt      | returns the encrypted messaged. It can be passed a second argument to change the encryption key                                                                 |
